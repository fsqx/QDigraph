# QDigraph

Based on Qt, this library serves the purpose of generating vertexs and edges. All the functions are included in the head file. 

For some reasons, the code is not public. I hereby listed my compilation libraries in MIPS and X86, which were generated based on Qt 5.6. 

If you need anything else, please contact me.
